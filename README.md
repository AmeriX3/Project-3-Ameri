## Cars from video games
#### Racing games are fun to play. It gives you insight in the newer car models and enjoy driving and crashing really expensive cars. These games are limited in the amount of cars they can input in their games. So the question is, how many cars can we find in the real world?
----
#### For this project I used the game Froza 4 Horizon which has a great quantity of cars that seemed  appropriate for the project.

#### This website has a record of each instance of the cars in the game.  since it was formated in a readable webscraping was not difficult.
---
#### Next step is to use the information found in the website and relate it to the database. we can use a function to iterate all of the values in the Dataframe
---
#### after that we can graph to see how often did the cars show up in the dataframe

#### the amount of times it occurs is about 10%.
